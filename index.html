										<h3>First computer built at 15.</h3>
										<p>Decided to go at it, and build my first computer at the beginning of high school. It was lots of fun. I learned a lot and found a passion of mine I want to continue pursuing. A PC is something everyone deserves to have. When are you getting your dream PC?</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa fa-microchip "></span>
										<h3>Second computer/Lots of upgrading since then!</h3>
										<p>From owning prebuilt PC's, <em>BLEGH</em>, to building my first and second, I have had lots of upgrades. Maybe too many upgrades for my wallet... If thats what you wish to do, even better! Each computer has a capacity to get some plastic surgery to get a little pick-me-up. If upgrading your current PC is what you want, I am the guy for that.  </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa fa-users "></span>
										<h3>Experience helping others. </h3>
										<p>Have built, and assisted in building computers for many other friends and family. Each build has come out successful and they have enjoyed it a lot. Each one is built with careful planning, powerful components, and lots of love. <3 </p>
